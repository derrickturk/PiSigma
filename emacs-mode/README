To use pisigma-mode, add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

;; PiSigma mode
(add-to-list 'load-path "PATH")
(require 'pisigma-mode)

Change the PATH string to the directory containing pisigma-mode.el and
eri.el.  When you load *.pi files, pisigma-mode will be enabled.

Currently the emacs mode only features (partial) syntax highlighting
and indentation.  Support for improved syntax highlighting, code
snippets, and interaction with the pisigma REPL (similar to
haskell-mode/GHCi) is planned.
