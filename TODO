REPL
----

* When loading a syntactically incorrect file (from the command-line)
  one is left in the REPL, when loading a file with a type error one
  is thrown out of the REPL.

* When loading a syntactically incorrect file (from within the REPL)
  the resulting "context" (the files listed in the prompt) includes
  the given file. When a type error is encountered the given file is
  instead excluded.

Other things to do
==================

* Test suite.
  - Should include expected successes as well as expected failures.
  - Is the parser a left inverse of the pretty-printer?
